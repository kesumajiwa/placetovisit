<h2>Sungai Besi</h2>

<p><strong>Sungai Besi</strong> or <strong>Sungei Besi</strong> <strong>新街场</strong> is a town in the Federal Territory of <em>Kuala Lumpur</em>. The deepest tin mine in Malaysia is located here.[citation needed] Sungai Besi was a historical mining town with many heavy industries such as steelworks, waste steel plants and other steel industries. The town has since developed from a large area of village settlements.</p>

<p>The town is still in its original settings. The village structures are from the early days of the town. Most of the buildings are built from wood and the pathways are narrow. There is also a modest temple in the town area.

The vibrant area of Sungai Besi is located within the shops and the area near the police station. Sungai Besi has many street vendors and traders in wetmarkets who sell mostly food items and fruits.</p>
